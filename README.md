The code preprocesses a sample snippet of *eye tracking traces* from SMI's Eye Tracking Glasses and fuses them with corresponding *sample annotations (i.e., bounding boxes for different objects in the egocentric video frames)* to generate a consolidated *eye tracking event log* that captures visual behavior for the recording, which is described and discussed in the manuscript.
